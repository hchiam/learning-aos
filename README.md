Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

The library itself: <https://github.com/michalsnik/aos>

My fork of the **_anchoring triggers_** example: <https://codepen.io/hchiam/pen/MWywwdm>

My fork of the example of **_custom animation triggered by scroll position_**: <https://codepen.io/hchiam/pen/MWywwdo>
