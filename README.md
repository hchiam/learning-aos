# Learning AOS (Animate On Scroll) library

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

Where I first heard about it: <https://css-tricks.com/aos-css-driven-scroll-animation-library>

The library itself: <https://github.com/michalsnik/aos>

My fork of the **anchoring triggers** example: <https://codepen.io/hchiam/pen/MWywwdm>

My fork of the example of **custom animation triggeredÂ by scroll position**: <https://codepen.io/hchiam/pen/MWywwdo>
